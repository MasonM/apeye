Overview
========

APEye is a jQuery widget for issuing HTTP requests, designed to help document and test APIs. With a few lines of Javascript, you can let users experiment with your API without leaving the documentation. Unlike [hurl](http://hurl.it/) and [apigee](http://apigee.com), requests are handled entirely by the client -- no server-side proxy is needed.
